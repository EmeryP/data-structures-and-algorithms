# Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree
Traversing a binary tree and returning the largest value in the tree

## Challenge
Write a function called find-maximum-value which takes a binary tree as its only input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. The values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach & Efficiency
* Used recursion
* Big O of time is O(n) because the traversal time increases with the size of the tree. 
* Big O of space is O(1) as in all cases we'll only return a single max value.
