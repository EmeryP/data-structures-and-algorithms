## Challenge
The challenge was to write a function to find an arbitrary value in an array without using built in JavaScript methods. 

## Solution 
Use a binary search algorithm to cut the array in half and search the halves until you have cut the array down to a point in which the searchKey is equal to the mid value of the array.
