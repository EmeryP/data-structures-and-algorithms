# Singly Linked List
Methods to create and manipulate a singly linked list.

## Solution 
Create Node and LinkedList classes that can be used in conjunction with linked list methods as noted below.

## API
* The `insert` method can be invoked by calling `sll.insert(<value to add>)` and it will prepend the value to add to the singly linked list.
* The `includes` method can be invoked by calling `sll.includes(<value to find>)` and it will return a boolean suggesting whether or not the searched for value is included in the singly linked list.
* The `print` method can be invoked by calling `sll.print()` and it will print out the data value of all the links in the list in their order.
* The `append` method can be invoked by calling `sll.append(<val to append>)` and it will append the value to the Linked List.
* The `kthFromTheEnd` method can be invoked by running the tests with the Jest testing framework or calling `sll.kthFromTheEnd(<kth from the end value>)` in the `linked-list.js` file and running node `linked-list.js` from bash. The method will identify and return the value of the node that is in the position of kth from the end of the LinkedList. See solution image below for code-challenges-07 for visuals. 

## Solution for code-challenge-06

Used the same code base from the previous labs and added the 1 new method to it.
