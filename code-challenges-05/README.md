# Singly Linked List

## Challenge
Created methods to create singly linked lists. The methods include, `insert` to add values to a list, `includes` to check if the list includes a value, and `print` to print the contents of the list.

## Solution 
Create a Node and LinkedList class that can be used to run methods against to easily reproduce new Nodes.

## API
* The `insert` method can be invoked by calling `sll.insert(<value to add>)` and it will prepend the value to add to the singly linked list
* The `includes` method can be invoked by calling `sll.includes(<value to find>)` and it will return a boolean suggesting whether or not the searched for value is included in the singly linked list.
* The `print` method can be invoked by calling `sll.print()` and it will print out the data value of all the links in the list in their order.
